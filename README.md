Development Stages

If the project were to be reopened, the following additions and upgrades would be considered:

    Integration of Google Maps and development of Google Lens functionality
    Upgrading the home module
    Mobile application development process
    Upgrading to newer versions of libraries and frameworks

Please note that this project is my first foray into AI, and while I haven't extensively studied neural networks, I have implemented this project using libraries such as GTK (Graphical User Interface Toolkit), OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, and R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) connected to both CPU and GPU. The UI has been updated, and the latest modules have been incorporated into the project.

Feel free to explore the project and provide any feedback or suggestions. Contributions are always welcome!
